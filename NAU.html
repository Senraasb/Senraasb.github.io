     <blockquote> “Avo...Alkins. ”</blockquote>
 Avo looked over at the short statured woman, she stood at 5’3 and had a blonde pixie cut with thick
framed glasses covering her frame.
<blockquote>“Yes?”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Did you run your 8 miles?”<br></blockquote>
Avo stood to put his shoes on, grabbed a gallon of water and started his run. He would starts off  in little
sprints (?) and then gradually build up. Outside the weather was cloudy, with little spurts of drizzle.
That's one thing he hated about living in the north west. It was constantly raining.
But he had a complicated relationship with
the rain. <br>
When he was removed from his mother's care. It was a rainy day, so he used these days to his
advantage and let the tears fall. It was on these days he could mourn the death of his mother and maybe
on a dreadful the death of an uncle he barely knew nothing about. After chaos erupted in the Union,
formerly known as, the United States. Leader or Mistress, Asisa Caudill rose to power. And with her power came grave changes, for example, at the age of 14 each child regardless of gender identification was admitted into the NAU Protective Services. 
Avo wasn’t exempt from this treacherous ordeal; he was required to run 7 miles each day. Each child was removed from their parental care, and forced to reside in <i>“Lectilum Adolescent.”</i>
<br> These were subpar military housing for potential military personnel. You see, at the age of 14 everyone
is moved from their comfortable housing and forced to reside here. By the age of 18 you have to take a
test and hope that you’ll get accepted into the branch you hope for. That was everyone dream to fight for this country that undoubtedly turn their noses up at its own citizens for menial reasons. 
My former teacher Mr.Morris was jailed and later killed after the shutdown of educational services because of the November Procession. <br>
<blockquote>“Avo did you see the game?”</blockquote> I turned over to look his friend Leo. <br>
“No, Leo how was it?” <br>
Leo eyes brighten up and his face immediately showed glee at the opportunity to tell his friend at the
events from last night.
“<blockquote>, before it was cut off due to a local slaying; Zacatecas was leading the game with 15 points, and he almost fought that weird headed kid I forgot his name though.” <br>
Avo looked at his friend puzzled, “what slaying?” <br> </blockquote>
“Advocate Johannes led the final procession of Franky Miles. You don’t remember the woman that went
‘missing’ for weeks at sea on a military operation? That’s all they talked about up until yesterday.”
Avo bent down to tie his shoes, “If I did, would I ask you Leo?” <br>
Leo let out a soft chuckle, “Well I don’t see what you’re not hip to all these killings you want to be a
military official, right?”
Avo stood up and looked at his friend, “I think we all do that’s why we are here.” <br>
“Not me, I want to be a detective. I want to help bring this regime down.”<br> Avo yanked his friends arm;
whispering harshly, “Don’t let anyone hear you say that.” <br>
<br><blockquote>“Or what?” </blockquote> Leo rebuffed. Avo gave his friend a harsh glare before getting into position for his daily runs. <br>
Avo liked to run; he enjoyed the sense of freedom that came with it. It was the only thing he could
control. He would start off in small sprints and work his way up; this lead to the creation of his running style. He discovered this method after
spraining his ankle right before the Marion Battles. The Marion Battles were held once every two years
for all the residents in the Lectiliums. This is a chance to show the skills you learnt during your residency here; and hopefully gain an advisor. An advisor could help you into a military home supoprted by your skillset and gave you tips for the Lacriman or the Skin of Tears for increased chances of survival.
 Avo felt as though he missed out on a vital opportunity because of his ankle. Although everyone around him didn’t feel the same; they all considered him to be a top pick into the Pack of Wolves.
  The Niqor’s were notoriously known for being exclusive; after all, the majority of itsmembers resided in the woods with housing in a 15 miles distance between them. They weren’t allowed to leave
their bases without special requests, or once a month to visit family or for a day of relaxation. The Niqors trained day in and day out, this specialized group has their own special language that when you first start
out, you must study it for 8 hours a day, have to follow a strict diet, and play numerous mind games. The Wolfs prevented escaping as well as invasion. Which is why they lived on the outskirts.
 But, Avo didn’t care about this; this was the Branch he wanted to be in. That’s what he wanted to do for the rest of his life;  to defend his country, the North American Union. Avo was taken out of his reverie by a wheezing Leo next to him. <br>
<blockquote>“You know you should take your inhaler often before your runs.” </blockquote>He said annoyed. <br>
“I would, but this Asthma is going to come in handy on the Yhutir because you’ll see me in the stands and not completing.” <br>
“How do you want to be a detective and you cannot even appropriately take your medication? That
doesn’t even make sense.” <br>
“It will to someone; one day.” <br>
“Whatever.”<br>
Avo continued on his run leaving his friend behind in bliss. In a reverie of what was. He missed his
mother deeply and he wondered what the outside world was like. He didn’t like this way of living but he
had to make the best of it. Sometimes he wondered how the world once was. Everyday seemed to be the
same Eerie and grey. For fun sometimes him and his friends went camping or for a swim in the lake. But
he often wondered was it more? More than to what it is now? Unfortunately he would never be able to see
the plight of his answers. This what would make him cry today. <br>
<blockquote>“Hey, man you forgot me!” <br></blockquote>
Leo said pushing his friend.
<blockquote>“Leo, not right now. You don’t want these problems.”
“What’s up with you? You leave me behind and I finally catch up with you and your crying? What
happened?” <br>  </blockquote>
<blockquote>“Nothing, I’ll see tomorrow in the cantine for breakfast.”  <br>
“You’re not coming to dinner tonight? They’re making your favorite.”</blockquote>
 “Leo, what did I just say?” 
<blockquote>“I’ll sneak you some.” </blockquote> <br> Leo said as his friend walked off.
Avo walked deeper into the woods almost falling over a rock. He didn’t want to go too far because he
would be in uncharted territories but he needed to get away. From what that was. He started to think about
things, such as making a list of things he had to do before the week was out. He needed to assist his
teacher on his research project as it was a part of his grade to gain better marks. Which he needed deeply, to give him a better edge at pulling into his respective branch and getting an advisor.
<blockquote><br> "Help, someone help!” <br>  Avo heard clawing and banging from a nearby building.
<br>“Help, me!”<br> </blockquote>
Avo turned around to figure out where the banging was coming from. He angstily, walked closer and
close in the direction of the noise before stumbling on a building that looked abandoned but to the trained eye you can tell it was locked from the outside. How the hell do they get in? Avo thought to himself. He saw a flashlight and keys starting to jingle so he hid. 
Right behind the rock he almost tripped over. He saw the man slightly move a curtain covering a crack space and the man took his keys out and unlocked the interior door. “Where is she?” Avo heard the man call into the walkie talkie. <br> “Ka Dvier Bein Jo!” <br>
Before he knew it he saw a light flicker on and a hard bang.
<br> <i>“Ka Dvier Bein Jo!” </i>Avo thought to where he heard this phrase before since it sounded familiar. But he
couldn’t. He got up from the rock and started walking back into his room.
