        Welcome to my writing portfolio! I finally got the courage and strength to make one, and after much deliberation, I've decided to showcase it on Github.
        <br> If you're reading this, then first and foremost, I would like to thank you for clicking the link and navigating to this page.
        Within these digital pages, you can see that this site was built to showcase my writing over the years, from academia to story-telling.
        Writing is my creative outlet; it's where you don't have to adhere to <i>others</i> rules and may do as you please.
<br>
        So long as you get your message across.
       
        All of my work can be found elsewhere on this site. Navigate to the links below; it'll be worth your while. Some of the works are not finished, and unfortunately, one of my best pieces, <a href="NAU.html" target="_blank"> NAU</a>
        happens to be one. However, rest assured, I am definitely looking into finishing it because every time I read it, I feel inspired all over again.
        <br> <br>
        Anyway, take your time, browse through my very short portfolio for <i>now</i>, and get inspired.
